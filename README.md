# Extended Crafting Terminal for Applied Energistics 2 Unofficial Extended Life (1.12)


## About
This mod adds four crafting terminals and four wireless crafting terminals that correspond with the BlakeBr0's [Extended Crafting](https://github.com/BlakeBr0/ExtendedCrafting) mod. This mod was created because I got annoyed having to use specifically the Extended Crafting tables to do recipes, when all of my resources are in the ME system. This is especially annoying for small-batch recipes. This mod addresses this by simply making a tier of each temrinal.

This mod was created on top of the [GregTechCEU build scripts](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/Buildscripts) and took some heavy inspiration from [AE2-UEL](https://github.com/AE2-UEL/Applied-Energistics-2)'s source code. Other sources include but are not limited to:
 - [Thaumic Energistics](https://github.com/Nividica/ThaumicEnergistics)
 - [AE2-UEL Fluid Crafting Rework](https://github.com/AE2-UEL/AE2FluidCraft-Rework)
 - [Neeve's AE2 Additions](https://github.com/AE2-UEL/NAE2)

I do not know what the license for this mod should be, since there is a non-insignificant amount of copied & modified code from AE2, consider it the GPL license (see LICENSE). If you want to use this mod in a modpack, please do! I'd love to hear about it.

----

This mod was made for [Nomifactory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomifactory), a GregTech CEU modpack, but will hopefully be included in other 1.12 modpacks that include Extended Crafting.
